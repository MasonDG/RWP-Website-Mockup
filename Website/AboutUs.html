  About Us              </h2>
  
  <h2>
    Our Mission
    </h2>
    <p> We are surrounded by many methods of help to keep track of our fitness and health goals. One powerful tool people use for health and fitness tracking are Fitness Bands, courtesy of various manufacturers
      such as Xiaomi, FitBit and many more. Unfortunately, we can not compare our fitness and health statistics captured across different brands unless we directly communicate with others, and looking at various graphs
      and complicated data can be a drag! Therefore, what better way to implement a community platform that combines the data generated using these fitness trackers and allow users to compare their statistics with each other in a no-fuss way.</p>
      <h2>
    Our Goals
    </h2>
    <p> The goal is simple. As explained above, we hope this new platform of fitness tracking and data collection combines your already existing data from your tracker which can then be used to compare to other users across different brands.
      In addition to this, data will also be formatted into a leaderboard based on a score algorithm we apply to every user in various categories (Steps taken, Calories burnt etc.) and compete for badges! We hope this platform offers users the easiest and most effective
      way to share their fitness achievements with others without the existing restrictions!</p>
    <br>
      <p> We hope you enjoy using this platform and get the most out of being united with many others across different fitness trackers!
